# UPI-Transaction-Failure-Predictor-and-Notifier
This system will aim to analyze various factors that might contribute to UPI transaction failures and notify the user ahead of time when a transaction is likely to fail. The prediction can be based on historical transaction data, network conditions, and potential issues with the bank servers, payment gateways, etc.

Key Objectives:
Predict Potential UPI Transaction Failures – Analyze patterns in past UPI transactions to predict failure before it happens.
Notify Users in Advance – Provide notifications about potential issues like insufficient funds, server errors, network problems, etc., before the user tries to make a transaction.
Improve UPI Experience – Enhance the user experience by reducing the anxiety of failed transactions and enabling users to take action in advance.
Steps to Build the Project:
1. Data Collection
Sources of Data:
You can look for publicly available datasets on UPI transaction failures, if any, or partner with a UPI service provider (e.g., Google Pay, PhonePe) to get access to transaction logs.
If you can't get real-time data, you can simulate failure data or create a dummy dataset based on common failure scenarios.
Transaction Data:
Date and time of transaction.
Transaction amount.
Sender and recipient details (partially, for privacy).
Device information.
Transaction status (Success/Failure).
Error messages (if any) and failure reasons (e.g., network issue, insufficient balance, wrong credentials, etc.).
2. Feature Engineering
Identify Features that Could Predict Failures:
Time of day (rush hours could affect servers, leading to failures).
Network quality (Wi-Fi vs. mobile data).
Amount thresholds (large transactions might be more likely to fail).
Bank server status or maintenance periods.
User's past transaction history (errors they have faced before).
Create Failure Prediction Model:
Label the data as "Failure" or "Success" and feed this into a machine learning model.
Use supervised learning algorithms (like decision trees, random forests, or logistic regression) to predict failures.
Alternatively, for more advanced predictions, deep learning models (like neural networks) could be employed if you have enough data.
3. Real-Time Prediction Engine
Integrate with UPI APIs (where possible, like UPI SDKs provided by banks or third-party services):
Monitor the transaction request in real time.
Predict the likelihood of failure based on the input data (such as amount, time of the day, network strength).
Use the trained model to analyze if a failure is likely to occur.
4. Notification System
Alert User in Advance:
If the model predicts a failure is highly probable, notify the user via push notification, email, or SMS.
The notification could contain tips to avoid failure, such as "Make sure your bank balance is sufficient" or "Try using a stronger network connection."
You could also integrate a fail-safe warning (e.g., an estimated 90% failure likelihood) just before the transaction is initiated.
5. User Interface (UI)
Design an Intuitive Dashboard:
Let users manually check the status of upcoming transactions.
Display predictions for each transaction with a confidence score (e.g., “This transaction has a 70% chance of succeeding”).
Allow users to customize notifications (e.g., setting thresholds for risk alerts).
6. Evaluation
Accuracy of Prediction:
You could evaluate your model using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
Also, measure how well the prediction system reduces actual transaction failures when users are notified and take corrective actions.

Technologies Used
1. Frontend:
HTML5: Used for structuring the web pages, creating the forms and input fields for user interactions.
CSS3: Used for styling the webpage, making it responsive and visually appealing.
JavaScript: Handles form submissions, communicates with the Flask backend via fetch API, and displays the prediction and alert results dynamically.
2. Backend:
Flask: A lightweight Python web framework used to handle HTTP requests and serve the prediction model logic.
SQLite: A simple, self-contained SQL database used to store transaction records, predictions, and alerts for later reference.
Python: The backend logic, including receiving the prediction request, invoking Java logic, and returning the response.
Flask-CORS: A Flask extension to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow communication between the frontend and backend.
3. Prediction Logic:
Java: Used to implement the prediction model for determining the likelihood of a UPI transaction failure based on the network status and transaction amount.
Java Runtime: The Java prediction logic is invoked from Flask using the subprocess module to run the Java program.
4. Tools & Libraries:
Git: Used for version control to manage and track code changes.
GitHub: Used for hosting the code and collaborating with others (if needed).
Visual Studio Code (or any text editor): Used for writing the code.
